A Rust crate for calculating optimal (shortest) paths for car-like vehicles using Reeds-Shepp curves. This implementation allows for both forward and backward motion and assumes a fixed turning radius (normalized to 1).

The paths are generated by exploring a set of 12 fundamental path families and their variations through time-flipping (reversing gear) and reflection (reversing steering).

## Features

* Calculates shortest paths between two poses (x, y, orientation).
* Supports forward and backward motion (`Gear::Forward`, `Gear::Backwards`).
* Defines discrete steering states (`Steering::Left`, `Steering::Right`, `Steering::Straight`).
* Provides a clear path representation as a sequence of `PathElement`s.
* Includes utility functions for pose manipulation, angle normalization, and coordinate conversions.
* Based on the principles described by Reeds & Shepp for path generation.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
reeds_shepp_lite_rs = "0.1.0"
